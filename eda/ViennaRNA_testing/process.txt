Start with <AA>-extract.txt produced by extract_type_ii.sh (+manually found indices of V-loop region)
Use vim macro to
    Start each label with >
    Delete comma and create new line between label and V-loop sequence
    Delete all periods and hyphens used for alignment in sequence
        Replace (?<=^[^>][AUCG]*)(\.|-)+ with empty string
            Look behind to make sure that line doesn't start with >, which identifies a label
            Match strings of periods and hyphens
    Making fasta files with constraints:
        Put cursor at start of line on V arm sequence
        yyp (yank line and paste below)
        R x.< (enter replace mode, replace first three chars with x (base is unpaired), . (no constraint), < (base is paired with a later base))
        :s/[AUCG]\./g (replace all remaining bases in line with . (no constraint))
        $ r x (go to end of sequence and replace last base with x (base is unpaired))
        jj0 (go down to lines and go to start of line, getting ready to rerun the macro)
