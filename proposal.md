# Proposal

* Project Name: [tRNA](https://github.com/ds5500/fall-2024/blob/main/project-list.md#trna)
* Team Members: Varun Guttikonda and Samee Mushtak
* Goal: The primary aim of this project is to create an automated pipeline that will align tRNA sequences from various species found in the [Genomic tRNA Database](https://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/) (GtRNAdb) against reference primordial tRNA sequences using open-source sequence alignment algorithms. We will then use measures of genetic distance between sequences to create a "3-dimensional" phylogenetic tree that simultaneously visualizes evolutionary relationships between tRNA genomes found in the same species as well as different species.
