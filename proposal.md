# Proposal

* Project Name: [tRNA](https://github.com/ds5500/fall-2024/blob/main/project-list.md#trna)
* Team Members: Varun Guttikonda and Samee Mushtak
* Goal: The primary aim of this project is to create an automated pipeline that will process tRNA sequences of 220 Archaea species from the [Genomic tRNA Database](https://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/) (GtRNAdb) using a variety of open-source sequence alignment algorithms and develop metrics to assess the relative performance of each algorithm. We will then use the output of this pipeline to analyze and visualize the evolutionary distances between different genomes in the GtRNAdb.
